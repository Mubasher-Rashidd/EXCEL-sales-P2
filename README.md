This repository contains the **EXCEL-sales-P2** project, an interactive **Sales Dashboard** created using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales performance across different categories and regions, enabling insights into key metrics such as profits, top customers, and sales trends.

## Project Overview

The **Sales Dashboard** in this project analyzes sales data for multiple product categories and regions. Key charts and slicers are used to visualize sales performance over time and answer critical business questions. The dashboard provides an interactive experience for users to filter data and explore insights.

### Features

- **Sales by Category**: A chart showing sales data broken down by product categories (e.g., Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology).
- **Profit Gained Over Time**: A line chart tracking profit trends over time (monthly, quarterly).
- **Sales by State**: A map or bar chart showing sales distribution across different states.
- **Top 5 Customer Profits**: A chart identifying the top 5 customers by profit, helping to focus on high-value clients.
- **Monthly Profits**: A chart displaying monthly profit trends, helping to identify seasonal sales patterns.
- **Interactive Slicers**: Filters for year and category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology) to customize the dashboard and focus on specific data points.

## Stages of Data Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed any duplicate records from the dataset.
   - Ensured consistent formatting for dates, sales figures, and product categories.
   - Addressed missing or incorrect data using **find-and-replace** techniques.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Grouped sales data by product categories such as **Furniture**, **Office Supplies**, and **Technology**.
   - Applied basic and advanced **formulas** to calculate metrics such as total sales, total profit, and profit margin.

3. **Pivot Tables**:
   - Created **PivotTables** to summarize sales and profit data by category, state, and customer.
   - PivotTables allowed dynamic aggregation of data, making it easy to generate charts and visuals based on different dimensions.

4. **Charts**:
   - Created various **charts** to visualize the data:
     - **Sales by Category** (Funnel Chart)
     - **Profit Over Time** (Line Chart)
     - **Sales by State** (Map Chart)
     - **Top 5 Customer Profits** (Pie Chart)
     - **Monthly Profits** (Bar Chart)

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Integrated all charts into a cohesive **dashboard**, providing a comprehensive view of sales performance.
   - Used Excelâ€™s built-in charting tools to create visuals that are easy to understand and interpret.

6. **Slicers**:
   - Added **Slicers** for filtering data by **Year** and **Product Category** (Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology).
   - The slicers allow users to explore data by selecting specific years or product categories, making the dashboard more interactive and customizable.

## Business Requirements Answered

- **Sales by Category**: What are the total sales in each product category? (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)
  - The dashboard visualizes the sales data for each product category, providing a breakdown of sales performance.
  
- **Profit Gained Over Time**: How have profits changed over time?
  - A line chart shows the profit trend over time, helping to identify whether profits have been increasing or decreasing.

- **Sales by State**: How are sales distributed across different states?
  - A **Sales by State** chart displays the geographical distribution of sales, enabling a state-by-state comparison.

- **Top 5 Customers by Profit**: Which customers are generating the most profit?
  - The **Top 5 Customer Profits** chart lists the highest-profit customers, highlighting key accounts.

- **Monthly Profits**: What is the trend of profits month by month?
  - The **Monthly Profits** chart tracks profit changes on a month-to-month basis.

- **Interactive Filtering**: How can we analyze data by year or category?
  - The slicers allow users to select different years or product categories to dynamically filter the data in the charts and PivotTables.

## How to Use

1. Download and open the **EXCEL-sales-P2.xlsx** file in Microsoft Excel.
2. Use the **slicers** to filter the data by:
   - **Year**: Select a specific year to view the sales and profit data for that period.
   - **Category**: Choose between **Furniture**, **Office Supplies**, and **Technology** to focus on a particular product category.
3. Explore the different charts on the dashboard, such as **Sales by Category**, **Profit Over Time**, **Sales by State**, **Top 5 Customers by Profit**, and **Monthly Profits**.
4. The charts and tables will automatically update based on the slicer selections, allowing for an interactive data analysis experience.
